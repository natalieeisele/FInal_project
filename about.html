	<h2> About me... </h2>
	<p> 
	I am a young writer, but it took me awhile to figure out this is the place for me. I started off as a business major, but I wanted to have a career that enabled me to create. I want to write, design, edit and improve whatever I can. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I have worked in the financial office of a library, a custard shop, a music PR firm, several restaurants and the student Union. I have held a variety of positions, but the ones I love most are when I have the chance to create. 	
	
	</p>
	
	
	
	<p>
	I’m a student at Indiana University Bloomington. I have fallen in love with this town (and what’s not to love)! I love exploring here – it is considered a small town by many, but I still stumble upon new things after being here for nearly four years. I love the atmosphere it has because so many students walk the streets here. The campus is beautiful, the restaurant scene is amazing (I’ve tried so much food), and the people I’ve met are unique and inspiring. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	As a journalist, I’ve gotten a chance to learn even more about certain aspects of the community that I might not have noticed otherwise. I got to meet with, interview and get a tour of Indiana’s first distillery, Cardinal Spirits (I got to taste-test too!). I took pictures of the Miss Indiana University Pageant at the Union, and the Bernie Sanders rally at the IU Auditorium. I met with the coordinator and several artists from the Bloomington Handmade Market, a local bi-annual event with over a hundred artists showcasing their work.  
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I love learning, and creating from that to share a story. I love hiking when the weather’s nice, trying new restaurants, being with my crazy dog Bella, practicing yoga and writing. I love wine and beer almost equally, ice cream, smoothies and a well-made salad. And I am passionate about sharing whatever story I can with you!
